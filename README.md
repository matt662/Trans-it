# Get There!

##Intro
4G06 Capstone Project.
The Capstone project is a year long project that happens in the final year of every engineering degree at McMaster University.

This Project was created by:  
  * Matt Fluder
  * Thomas Miele 
  * Nicholas Mio 
  * Mike Ngo
  * Jim Rabaya
  
This project required us to go through the entire software development lifecycle.  
In detail, this required us to:
* Gather Requirements
* Write a requirements documment
* Do a Hazard Analysis
* Learn the Android Framework
* Work with protocol buffers
* Use the Google Maps API + a few others
* Write a Validation and Verification Document
  
##The App
The application is a user friendly wrapper for the HSR realtime bus data that Hamilton released. The data is in the GTFS format.  
The main requirements of the app were

1. To display the real-time location of busses on a map.
2. To retrieve the actual arrival times of busses to a particular stop (Not the scheduled times).
4. To allow users to plan trips from point A to point B.
5. To condense the information into a "favorites" screen for easy access.
6. To do all this in a user-friendly and intuitive way.

####Bus Check  
The Bus check allows you to enter a stop code and see all the busses that will be arriving soon at the stop.

####Route Map
The Route Map shows the location of all busses with a user selected route number on a map.

##Future
The Application is currently being polished and is expected to be put on the Google Play Market in June 2015, for free.
Because of the standardized format of the data, it is possible for the app to be extended to include cities other than Hamilton as well, if the App gets enough support.
